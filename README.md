# Project: Rails & React Booking App - *Mia Music Bookings*

## Purpose

Our hypothetical client, Mia Music, is a teacher of guitar, piano and singing to students of all ages. She conducts her lessons both in person at her studio in Penny Lane, Melbourne, and virtually over Zoom to students at their homes.

Presently, her students book lessons with her variously by text message, phone call and email. Mia finds this part of her business to be labour-intensive and cumbersome for both her and her students.

Mia is looking for a solution that improves the booking experience for her and her students. She has engaged us to develop a full-stack web app through which:

1. her students can book and manage their lessons; and
2. she can view and manage all of her lessons.

## Functionality

### Users

- View information on Mia and her services
- View information on lesson pricing
- Contact Mia via a contact form
- Sign up as a student
- Log in to student profile
- Log out of student profile
- Book a lesson under student profile (selecting location, date and time)
- View all past and future lessons under student profile
- Change a lesson under student profile
- Cancel a lesson under student profile

### Owner

## Target audience

Our target audience comprises all of Mia's present and prospective music students. These students span all ages and demographics. Therefore, the app will need to be accessible to this wide audience.
