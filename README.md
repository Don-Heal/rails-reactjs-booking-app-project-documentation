# Project: Rails & React Booking App - *Mia Music Bookings*

## Purpose

Our hypothetical client, Mia Music, is a teacher of guitar, piano and singing to students of all ages. She conducts her lessons both in person at her studio in Penny Lane, Melbourne, and virtually over Zoom to students at their homes.

Presently, her students book lessons with her variously by text message, phone call and email. Mia finds this part of her business to be labour-intensive and cumbersome for both her and her students.

Mia is looking for a solution that improves the booking experience for her and her students. She has engaged us to develop a full-stack web app through which:

1. her students can book and manage their lessons; and
2. she can view and manage all of her lessons.

## Functionality

### Users

- View information on Mia and her services
- View information on lesson pricing
- Contact Mia via a contact form
- Sign up as a student
- Log in to student profile
- Log out of student profile
- Book a lesson under student profile (selecting location, date and time)
- View all past and future lessons under student profile
- Change a lesson under student profile
- Cancel a lesson under student profile

### Owner

- Log in as administrator
- View all booked lessons
- Add a lesson
- Change a lesson
- Cancel a lesson
- Receive all messages submitted through the app's contact form

## Target audience

Our target audience comprises Mia and all of Mia's present and prospective music students. These students span all ages and demographics. Therefore, the app will need to be accessible to this wide audience.

## User stories

**Persona one:** Eugene User is a 30-year-old professional who has been self-learning guitar for the past six months. He now wishes to see a teacher for guitar and, potentially, voice lessons once a week. He discovered Mia's website by searching online for teachers located in the Melbourne CBD.

**Persona two:** Mia Music is a teacher of guitar, piano and singing to students of all ages. She conducts her lessons both in person at her studio in Penny Lane, Melbourne, and virtually over Zoom to students at their homes.

As **Eugene**, I want to:

1. View information on Mia and her services so that I can assess whether she is the right teacher to help me achieve my goals
2. View information on lesson pricing so that I can assess whether these lessons fall within the appropriate financial range for me
3. Contact Mia via a contact form in order to ask her any questions I have before committing to booking a lesson
4. Sign up as a student so that I have a student profile from which to book and manage my lessons
5. Log in to my student profile so that I can book and manage my lessons
6. Log out of my student profile so that use of my profile is secure
7. Book a lesson under my student profile, including by selecting location, date and time, so that I can unilaterally plan and lock in my future lessons at locations, dates and times that suit me best
8. View all past and future lessons under my student profile so that I can check when my past lessons were or future lessons are in the event I need to recall that information
9. Change a lesson under my student profile so that I can reschedule lessons in the event my plans change and a different location, date or time would suit me better
10. Cancel a lesson under my student profile so that I can withdraw my commitment to undertaking a lesson if my plans change and it no longer suits me to attend that lesson

As **Mia**, I want to:

11.  Log in to the app as its administrator so that I can carry out the booking administration of my teaching business
12.  View all booked lessons so that I can be informed of all my lessons commitments and manage my work days accordingly
13.  Add a lesson so that I can record any lessons that I arrange outside of the app (for example, there may be instances where I still arrange lessons by conversing with a student)
14.  Change a lesson so that I can reschedule lessons in the event there is a need to do so and I know of a suitable location/date/time for reschedule
15.  Cancel a lesson so that I can withdraw my commitment to providing a lesson if my plans change and providing that lesson is not feasible or desirable
16.  Receive all messages submitted through the app's contact form so that I can be informed of any messages from students or prospective students and act accordingly (for example, by calling them to discuss the prospect of lessons)
